                            <p>Children are the centre of universe, their welfare and happiness must be our ultimate goal. Education is a tool that can empower our children to change the destiny of a nation. We felt the need to have this right kind of education at GASMPS, that provides global outlook with roots firmly embedded in our culture.

                                GAS Memorial Public School Path under the GAS Social Trust has a legacy of its own in the field of education, it will not only provide quality education par excellence but will also create a platform for positive, progressive likeminded people to converge and create. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central conception of education in India has been that it is the source of illumination guiding us in all spheres of life. It takes into account the entire sphere of life giving a sense of perspective and proportion.

                                We have set very high goals and standards for our institution .Each and every student will be provided with opportunity to realize his or her potential by focussing on individual differences and right frequency between teacher and the taught. The education imparted must ensure students learn how to think rather than what to think. Education is about the total configuration of ideas, practices and conduct.

                                As Dr. Abdul Kalam said "I have three visions for India, Freedom, Development and Strength. Our students will imbibe these qualities in the conducive environment created at school and train to be competent professionals, responsible citizens and future world leaders."</p>

This not only encompasses a challenging academic program, but also the development of good character, respect for elders, an appreciation of the fine arts, a curiosity about the world, a passion for knowledge, an understanding of technology, and a commitment to make the world and the society a better place.
